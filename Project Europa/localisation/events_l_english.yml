 POL_event.2.d:0 "On the death of the last Piast monarch in 1370, Polish nobles began drawing on ancient claims and historical precedent to assert their independence from the monarchy. At first, only a small part of the szlachta, or 'noble class', would assert its privilege to choose the next king (or, in 1384 and 1523 Queen, since they backed Jadwiga's and Anna's claims). But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Poland was extended to Polish nobles. Keep in mind that in Poland, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Poles could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until American and French Republics. True royal elections began in 1573 at the election of Henry of Valois, since foreign princes were always claiming the Polish throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Poland and Grand Princes of Lithuania were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wola, just outside Warsaw. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men. While the election was going on, royal power would be vested in an interrex, a temporary regent - usually the Primate of Warsaw, who would oversee the voting."

Victories won by hetman Jan Sobieski only temporarily forestalled the threat, and in 1672 the Commonwealth faced a major invasion by the Ottoman Empire. The fall of the key border fortress Kamieniec Podolski was followed by the humiliating Peace of Buczacz. In 1683 Sobieski led a relief army to Vienna, besieged by the Ottomans, and as supreme commander of the allied forces won a resounding victory that marked the beginning of Ottoman withdrawal from Europe."

 HUN_CW_event.10.t:0 "Envoys from Hungary"
 HUN_CW_event.10.d:0 "John Hunyadi, esteemed general and elected ruler of the Kingdom of Hungary, has proposed a coalition of the Balkan despots to defend against threats both within and outside of Christendom. Although controversial, it has merit in its utility to secure [ROOT.GetName] against Ottoman, Austrian and Polish interference alike. Hunyadi has also sent similar envoys to our neighbours and should they accept, refusing could risk exposing ourselves to yet another threat.."
 HUN_CW_event.10.a:0 "United we shall vanquish these threats!"
 HUN_CW_event.10.b:0 "This is absurd."
 HUN_CW_event.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Joins the Balkan Coalition"
 HUN_CW_event.11.d:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] emissaries have agreed to join our coalition! They have cited their concerns of the stability of the Balkans and the increasing threats of external interference. As the leader of this faction, we must keep in mind the interests of [FROM.GetName] if we are to remain a regional hegemon."
 HUN_CW_event.11.a:0 "Excellent."
 HUN_CW_event.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refutes the Balkan Coalition"
 HUN_CW_event.12.d:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] emissaries have declined our invitation, citing the absurdity of the proposal and their reluctance to involve themselves in meaningless conflicts. Although this was anticipated, such a refusal is a disgrace against our nation and many advise us to be wary of [FROM.GetName]’s intentions in the future."
 HUN_CW_event.12.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 HUN_CW_event.13.t:0 "Petition from Hungary"
 HUN_CW_event.13.d:0 "Władysław III of Poland, de jure ruler of the Kingdom of Hungary, has petitioned the Holy See to assist in their civil strife claiming his victory to be paramount to the security of Christendom against the Ottoman threat. Should we grant this request and recognise his cause as legitimate, the masses would flock to volunteer for Władysław’s army, albeit jeopardising Papal relations with the Holy Roman Emperor for the near future."
 HUN_CW_event.13.a:0 "Under current circumstances, we must grant this."
 HUN_CW_event.13.b:0 "We cannot show such favouritism."
 HUN_CW_event.14.t:0 "Papacy Approves the Petition"
 HUN_CW_event.14.d:0 "The Papacy has responded to our petition for aid and now endorse our struggle as holy and in alignment with the interests of the Holy See. They cite that once stabilised, the union under Władysław III will be paramount to the security of Christendom against the rising Ottoman threat. Such an endorsement will assist with our popularity in the region and spur many devout Christians to enrol in our forces."
 HUN_CW_event.14.a:0 "Excellent."
 HUN_CW_event.15.t:0 "Papacy Refuses the Petition"
 HUN_CW_event.15.d:0 "The Papacy have officially declined our petition for aid in our civil strife, citing fears of angering the Imperial court in Vienna. Although such a refusal is a humiliation to Władysław III, we can leverage this defeat to curry favour with other, heretical factions to bolster our influence in the region."
 HUN_CW_event.15.a:0 "Damn."
