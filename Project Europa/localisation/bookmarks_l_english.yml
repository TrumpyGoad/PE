 CRUSADE_OF_VARNA_NAME:0 "Crusade of Varna"
 CRUSADE_OF_VARNA_DESC:0 "The death of Holy Roman Emperor Albert II on October 27th, 1439 destabilised Eastern Europe and left a power vacuum in the region. Encouraged by this, the Ottomans renewed their incursions into Christendom. Through diplomacy, Pope Eugene IV initiated the Crusade of Varna, led by the 'Bulwark of Christianity' Władysław III of Poland and was Eastern Europe's final chance to prevent the Ottoman Empire from establishing a regional hegemon over the Balkan region. Will Europe repel this impending threat or will the Ottoman Empire rise to threaten the heart of Christianity itself?"

 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC:0 "The death of Władysław III and decisive defeat of the coalition at the Battle of Varna on November 11th, 1444 once again left the Balkans vulnerable to foreign incursions. The Ottoman Empire, now unrivalled in their regional dominance looks to the remnants of the Roman Empire seek to inherit. Will the Ottomans remain unchallenged in their rise to power and come to dominate all of Eurasia or will other powers, both Christian and Muslim, unite to confront them?"
 FALL_OF_AN_EMPIRE_NAME:0 "Fall of an Empire"
 FALL_OF_AN_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "Byzantine Empire has long been a bastion for civilisation and a harbour of international trade for centuries. However, centuries riddled with conflict diminished its holdings until only parts of Greece and Constantinople, the largest city in Europe and ‘City of World’s Desire’, remained. It is this legacy that is now under existential threat from the Ottomans as the newly crowned Mehmed II sought to conquer these remnants and mark the beginning of a new age in which the Ottoman Empire is dominant. What will become of the Byzantines? Will they be eradicated by foreign powers or will they fight back and be born anew?"
